2       # numCPU: Number of CPU cores
rr      # scheduler: Scheduling algorithm (round-robin)
4       # quantumCycles: Instructions per quantum (only applies if RR)
1       # batchFreq: Ticks between process generation (smaller = faster spawn)
100     # minIns: Minimum number of instructions per process
100     # maxIns: Maximum number of instructions per process
0       # delayPerExec: Delay multiplier for instruction execution (0 = no delay)
